Great progress! Here's what to expect in **Unit 2: Data Manipulation with Pandas and NumPy**:

---

### **Unit 2 Overview**
#### **Learning Objectives**
1. **Loading Data**:
   - Import datasets from local files, URLs, and Kaggle.
   - Understand file formats: CSV, Excel, and JSON.

2. **Working with Pandas DataFrames**:
   - Perform essential operations like filtering, sorting, and indexing.
   - Merge and join datasets.
   - Group, reshape, and aggregate data for analysis.

3. **Using NumPy for Numerical Computations**:
   - Work with arrays and perform element-wise operations.
   - Leverage broadcasting for efficient computations.
   - Handle missing or invalid data in arrays.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Clean and preprocess raw datasets.
   - Summarize data using descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc.).
   - Spot trends and patterns using visual and numerical summaries.

### **Hands-On Exercises**
Weâ€™ll practice:
- Loading and exploring datasets.
- Applying transformations (e.g., cleaning and merging data).
- Using NumPy for faster calculations.

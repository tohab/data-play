### Data structures

Most problems are solves by four data structures:
- list
- tuple
- set
- dictionary

A data set is a collection of values. All these data structures are of heterogenous elements. 

List
- ordered.
- made by test_list = [12, "banana", 5.3].
- mutable.
- duplicates okay. 

Tuple
- ordered
- test_tuple = (1, "John", 5.3)
- immutable. have to delete or create a new one.

Set
- unordered. no indices!
- mutable. you can insert and remove elements. 
- sets don't contain any duplicates!

Dictionary
- like a set, unordered. mutable. no duplicates.
- each item comes in pairs: key, and value. You can search keys and find the values.
- used a lot in pandas.

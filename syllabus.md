# Python for Business Intelligence and Data Science

## **Syllabus**

### **Prerequisites**
- Familiarity with programming concepts in Java or Python.
- VS Code installed and basic knowledge of how to use it.

---

### **Unit 1: Setting Up Your Environment and Python Refresh**
#### **Learning Objectives**
- Configure your Python environment in VS Code (Python extensions, virtual environments).
- Install key libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
- Refresher on Python for data science: list comprehensions, functions, and working with libraries.
- Introduction to Git and GitHub for version control (in VS Code).

#### **Key Tools**
- VS Code (with Python and Git extensions).
- GitHub for repository hosting and version control.

---

### **Unit 2: Data Manipulation with Pandas and NumPy**
#### **Learning Objectives**
- Load datasets from local files, URLs, and Kaggle using Pandas.
- Master DataFrame operations: filtering, merging, grouping, reshaping, and aggregation.
- Perform numerical operations and array manipulations with NumPy.
- Practice exploratory data analysis (EDA).

#### **Mini-Project Idea After Unit 2**
1. Download a Kaggle dataset on climate trends or energy production.
2. Analyze key insights and clean/preprocess the dataset with Pandas.
3. Upload your work to GitHub with a README describing the analysis.

---

### **Unit 3: Creating Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn**
#### **Learning Objectives**
- Build and customize visualizations in Matplotlib: line plots, bar charts, scatterplots.
- Use Seaborn for advanced visualizations: box plots, pair plots, heatmaps.
- Learn visualization principles: clean, professional designs with titles, labels, and legends.
- Save visualizations in high-quality formats (PNG, SVG, etc.) for business reports.

---

### **Unit 4: Working with Kaggle Datasets and Automating Analysis**
#### **Learning Objectives**
- Download and explore datasets directly from Kaggle using APIs.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and large datasets efficiently.
- Automate repetitive tasks with Python: scripts for cleaning and visualizing data.
- Combine multiple datasets for richer analysis.

#### **Mini-Project Ideas After Unit 4**
1. Visualize global meat consumption trends using a Kaggle dataset.
2. Analyze sustainability metrics for alternative protein production.
3. Create a report summarizing chip production trends.

---

### **Unit 5: Data Storytelling and Report Generation**
#### **Learning Objectives**
- Learn techniques for crafting compelling data stories using Python visualizations.
- Generate polished reports using Matplotlib, Pandas, and Markdown (for GitHub).
- Automate report generation in PDF or HTML formats with Python libraries like `reportlab` or `weasyprint`.

---

### **Unit 6: Finalizing Projects and Building Your Portfolio**
#### **Learning Objectives**
- Create portfolio-ready GitHub repositories: proper file structure, scripts, notebooks, and README files.
- Document insights and workflows for potential employers.
- Polish visualizations and reports for presentations or publications.

#### **Capstone Project Ideas**
1. **Climate Trends Analysis:** Use a Kaggle dataset to visualize the impact of climate changes (e.g., CO2 emissions, temperature anomalies).
2. **Energy Production Dashboard:** Combine multiple Kaggle datasets to track global energy production and consumption trends.
3. **Alternative Proteins Report:** Create a visual and written report analyzing the global adoption of alternative proteins.

---

### **Deliverables**
- Two polished mini-projects (after Units 2 and 4).
- A final capstone project tailored for publication and showcasing on GitHub.

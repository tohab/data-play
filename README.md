# README: Python for Business Intelligence and Data Science with Code Buddy

## **Welcome!**
This repository is designed to help you learn Python for Business Intelligence and Data Science through an interactive, hands-on approach. While it was initially created as a personal learning project, it’s flexible enough for anyone to use and adapt to their needs.

The course content is organized in the `course-content` folder, where you’ll find:
- A detailed syllabus (`course-content/syllabus.md`).
- Descriptions of the units, added progressively as the course develops.
- instructions for the Code Buddy CustomGPT.

**Code Buddy** is a custom GPT-based tutor developed by Rohan Prasad. It can be used with any large language model (LLM) -- simply upload the syllabus and instructions for **Code Buddy** to get started!
